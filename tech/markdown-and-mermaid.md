# Markdown and Mermaid diagrams

## What it is

**Markdown** is a way to write formatted text in a plain file. A `#` at the start of a line makes a heading, `-` a bullet, backticks around words make `code`, and a row of `|` makes a table. GitHub and most editors show it formatted. **Mermaid** is a text language for diagrams: a fenced block starting with ```` ```mermaid ```` is drawn as a picture by GitHub, so a diagram can live in the repository as text and be changed in a diff.

## Why this repository uses it

This repository carries 50 Markdown files: the README with the lesson's Done-when table, ARCHITECTURE.md with the diagram of the layers and data flow, the architecture decision records, the changelog, and the prompt templates the program sends to models (a prompt is a text file, so it is versioned with the code).

## Where it appears

| File | What it does with this technology |
| --- | --- |
| `README.md` | How to run, the Done-when table, what is simplified. |
| `ARCHITECTURE.md` | The layers and a Mermaid data-flow diagram. |
| `docs/adr/*.md (6 files)` | One architecture decision record per decision. |
| `CHANGELOG.md` | What was added in each version. |
| `prompts/*.md (4 files)` | Prompt templates with `{{name}}` placeholders. |
| `reports/REPORT.md` | Generated, human-readable result reports. |


## How it works underneath

Markdown is processed by a program that turns marks into HTML. The common marks: `# Title`, `## Subtitle` (headings, the number of `#` is the level); `*italic*`, `**bold**`; `` `code` `` for short code and triple backticks for blocks (a word after the opening fence names the language); `- item` or `1. item` for lists; `[text](address)` for links; `|` columns with a `| --- |` line under the header for tables. A blank line separates paragraphs.

Mermaid is a small language that is turned into SVG drawing by JavaScript in the page that shows it. `flowchart LR` starts a flow chart; `a["text"] --> b["text"]` draws two boxes joined by an arrow; `{...}` makes a decision diamond; `[(...)]` a database cylinder; `-->` is a solid arrow and `-.->` a dashed one; `-- "words" -->` puts a label on the arrow; `<br/>` breaks a line inside a box.

## Walkthrough of this repository's use

### The diagram in `ARCHITECTURE.md`

```text
flowchart LR
    user["Customer message<br/>(or an attack)"] --> redact["Redact in<br/>typed placeholders"]
    redact --> iguard{"Input guard<br/>rules, then classifier<br/>for soft signals"}
    iguard -- "block" --> refuse["Designed refusal<br/>+ reason code"]
    iguard -- "allow" --> tool["find_order<br/>(read-only, not scoped)"]
    help["Help page"] --> dscan
    tool --> dscan{"Data scan<br/>same rules"}
    dscan -- "flagged" --> refuse
    dscan -- "clean" --> model["Assistant model<br/>canary in its prompt"]
    model --> oguard{"Output guard<br/>canary, foreign ids,<br/>prompt overlap"}
    oguard -- "block" --> refuse
    oguard -- "pass" --> restore["Restore own values,<br/>scrub strays"]
    restore --> reply["Reply"]
    suites["Attack suite + benign suite"] --> gate["Release gate<br/>vs recorded rates"]
```

`flowchart LR` means a flow chart drawn left to right. Each line below is one arrow:

| Line | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `user["Customer message<br/>(or an attack)"] --> redact["Redact in<br/>typed placeholders"]` | box **Customer message / (or an attack** to box **Redact in / typed placeholders**: solid arrow (the main flow) |
| `redact --> iguard{"Input guard<br/>rules, then classifier<br/>for soft signals"}` | box **Redact in / typed placeholders** to decision (diamond) **Input guard / rules, then classifier / for soft signals**: solid arrow (the main flow) |
| `iguard -- "block" --> refuse["Designed refusal<br/>+ reason code"]` | decision (diamond) **Input guard / rules, then classifier / for soft signals** to box **Designed refusal / + reason code**: solid arrow (the main flow), labelled "block" |
| `iguard -- "allow" --> tool["find_order<br/>(read-only, not scoped)"]` | decision (diamond) **Input guard / rules, then classifier / for soft signals** to box **find_order / (read-only, not scoped**: solid arrow (the main flow), labelled "allow" |
| `help["Help page"] --> dscan` | box **Help page** to decision (diamond) **Data scan / same rules**: solid arrow (the main flow) |
| `tool --> dscan{"Data scan<br/>same rules"}` | box **find_order / (read-only, not scoped** to decision (diamond) **Data scan / same rules**: solid arrow (the main flow) |
| `dscan -- "flagged" --> refuse` | decision (diamond) **Data scan / same rules** to box **Designed refusal / + reason code**: solid arrow (the main flow), labelled "flagged" |
| `dscan -- "clean" --> model["Assistant model<br/>canary in its prompt"]` | decision (diamond) **Data scan / same rules** to box **Assistant model / canary in its prompt**: solid arrow (the main flow), labelled "clean" |
| `model --> oguard{"Output guard<br/>canary, foreign ids,<br/>prompt overlap"}` | box **Assistant model / canary in its prompt** to decision (diamond) **Output guard / canary, foreign ids, / prompt overlap**: solid arrow (the main flow) |
| `oguard -- "block" --> refuse` | decision (diamond) **Output guard / canary, foreign ids, / prompt overlap** to box **Designed refusal / + reason code**: solid arrow (the main flow), labelled "block" |
| `oguard -- "pass" --> restore["Restore own values,<br/>scrub strays"]` | decision (diamond) **Output guard / canary, foreign ids, / prompt overlap** to box **Restore own values, / scrub strays**: solid arrow (the main flow), labelled "pass" |
| `restore --> reply["Reply"]` | box **Restore own values, / scrub strays** to box **Reply**: solid arrow (the main flow) |
| `suites["Attack suite + benign suite"] --> gate["Release gate<br/>vs recorded rates"]` | box **Attack suite + benign suite** to box **Release gate / vs recorded rates**: solid arrow (the main flow) |

### The shape of a decision record

`docs/adr/0001-record-and-replay-model-calls.md` has these headings:

```markdown
# 1. Record and replay model calls
## Context
## Decision
## Consequences
```

- The title is the number and the decision in a few words.
- *Context* says what problem made a decision necessary.
- *Decision* says what was chosen.
- *Alternatives considered* lists what was rejected and why.
- *Consequences* says what follows from the choice, good and bad. A reader six months later can understand the code's shape without asking anyone.

### The prompt templates

A prompt file is plain text. `{{name}}` marks a place the program fills in; the pattern that finds it is explained in `regular-expressions.md`. Keeping prompts in files under `prompts/` means a change to a prompt is a visible change in git, with a version in the file name (for example `classify.v2.md`) where the repository uses that habit.

## Try it yourself

1. `grep -n '^#' README.md | head -20` lists the README's headings, i.e. its outline.
2. `grep -c '^|' README.md` counts the table rows.
3. `awk '/^```mermaid/{f=1;next} /^```/{f=0} f' ARCHITECTURE.md` prints only the diagram source.
4. Paste that source into https://mermaid.live to see the drawing and edit it.
5. `ls docs/adr` lists the decision records in numeric order.

## Mistakes people make

- **A missing blank line** before a list or table, which then renders as part of the previous paragraph.
- **A table row with a different number of `|` than the header.**
- **A Mermaid label containing quotes or brackets without double quotes around the whole label.**
- **Editing generated reports by hand**: the next run overwrites them. Change the code or the data instead.
- **Treating the README as a log.** The README says how it is now; the changelog says what changed.

## Check yourself

1. **How do you make a level-2 heading?**  
   Start the line with `##` and a space.
2. **What does a fenced block with the word `mermaid` do on GitHub?**  
   It is drawn as a diagram.
3. **What does `-.->` mean in Mermaid?**  
   A dashed arrow.
4. **What are the four parts of an ADR?**  
   Context, Decision, Alternatives considered, Consequences.
5. **Why are prompts stored as files?**  
   So that a change to a prompt is versioned and reviewed like code.
