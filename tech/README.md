# Technology notes

These notes explain every technology that appears in `ai-guardrails-and-red-team`, one file per technology, for a reader who has never met any of them. Each file has the same nine parts: what it is, why this repository uses it, where it appears, how it works underneath, a walkthrough of this repository's own files and commands, things to try yourself, common mistakes, five questions to check yourself, and further reading. Code in the walkthroughs is quoted exactly from the repository (or, for `.env.example`, from the text its generator wrote), so you can open the file and follow along.
